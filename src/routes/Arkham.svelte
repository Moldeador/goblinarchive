          <p>Lucas Strong tried to pay ransom for kidnapped daughter Jane (16), but talks collapsed and two of the gang were killed. Vernon knows that the shooting started when criminals suddently shot into the forest.</p>
          <p>Surviving gang members/kidnappers:<p>
          <ul>
            <li>Sidney Harris (22)</li>
            <li>Eugene Clayton</li>
            <li>Christopher Dobbs</li>
          </ul> 
        </BlogItem>

        <BlogItem itemTitle={"First Day"}>
          <p>Lucas Strong hires/pressures and provisions townspeople to go find Jane & "capture" Sidney. Arthur & Nancy learned & shared some info:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Sidney Harris wanted to go to the excavation to find gold.</li>
            <li>"Kidnapped" girl might be in cohoots with Sidney? </li>
            <li>The gang have shotguns & 1 sniper rifle. </li>
            <li>Got rough location of hideout, it's 3-4 days' walk away.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Sheriff leads the teams to shootout site. Psychology, intel and tracks all indicate the NE path. Obsolete military clothing button found in approx. direction of the random shooting?</p>
          <p>Alaistair Lawson & son George mistake us for deer and shoot Arthur. Friends Arthur & son Brian are also in the forest, hunting and meeting artists deeper in. George is terrified of kidnappers and the lake due to a nightmare about drowning there (Brian had same nightmare?). They give us their guns and watch, and learning about the kidnapping, they vow to return to town.</p>
          <p>Huck tracking & navigating well, gets the group to a serviceable cabin he knows, shortly after dusk. Cabin has 1-2 day old extinguished fire on the floor. Found 1865 diary under floor, with last two entries showing some deserters' resolve to flee through the woods to Canada, but two months later still here, feeling the woods calling to them in some way. Found Eugene's torn discarded coat, with wallet containing merely a note, that only Vernon and Agy read and merely summarise it for the others that it's Eugene's wife begging him home.</p>
          <p>Vernon and Huck have disturbing nightmares.</p>
        </BlogItem>

        <BlogItem itemTitle="Second Day">
          <p>In the daylight, Nancy finds footprints and tracks heading N/NE from the cabin, consistent with where we expected the gang went. Huck finds that there are significantly fewer birds around than he is used to. Some of us hear a distant vehicle to the south, kind/location unclear, but possibly consistent with temporary forest roads and vehicles related to the lake excavations in the north/east area...? Vernon obviously lies to the group about the excavation traffic.</p>
          <p>We see a track nearly perpendicular to the presumed-gang tracks, with broken branches and some blood, indicating running. We follow it SE and find a rusty, bloody old hunting knife, and a dead artist with rude bandages (now ruptured) on a large abdominal wound. The wound is consistent with the same or similar knife, wielded by someone else, and an examination says they died yesterday. Gordon psychoanalyses that they were confused and navigating badly at the end, unclear if they were maybe trying to go south to the town?</p>
          <p>He has crumpled charcoal drawings of the lake and a forest cabin. Arthur Greenshade stares at the lake drawing and sees an occult sign that could not possibly be known to the artist, and becomes hysterical and yells questions at the corpse. Arthur Greenshade comes to his senses after straddling the corpse, shouting "How did you know?" at it. The party is concerned.</p>
          <p>There are 3 paths: the original trail of the criminals, the bloody trail of the artist, and a road that leads trucks to the Psychoanalysis cabin. The group decides to follow the trail of blood.</p>
          <p>A lorry comes as they set off - so they try to flag it down for information. It's James Stanton - Nancy knows him. He's carrying explosives to the excavation site and wants to get on with his job.  The party wants him to go back and inform the town of the murder. It's a tense exchange. He acts strange, sometimes spacing out. Also, wearing too thick a coat for the weather, and he's extremely pale. His connection with Lucas Strong's enterprise seems to anger Aggy. Eventually he goes on his way.</p>
          <p>3 Gunshots are hears in the distance shortly after in the direction of travel. The party accelerates, following the blood, not the gunshots</p>
          <p>It's Eugene with the sniper, he takes a shot at Aggy. The party hides before shouting an appeal to him, using his wife's name. He tells the party he's injured, tells them we're all in danger, He goes quiet. The party runs to his position, finds him shaking and mumbling. He rambles: "Tell Daisy I'm sorry! Tell her I tried", "They can't die, I shot them but they can't die", He has sustained a gunshot wound, possibly from the shootout - he's got a bad fever. He tells the party the cabin is North, before passing out.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile Arthur and Vernon keep following the blood trail - They find the artist's camp in disarray. In one of the tents they find a painting depicting a still lake surrounded with trees with yellowed leaves - a familiar scene from the dead artist's painting.</p>

          <p>Couple of things to add:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Some of us changed our mind to follow the trail of blood because Agy pointed out that the other boy and father had headed towards the artists.</li>
            <li>Some of us also noticed that James the lorry driver had cold, misty breath like Huck also had after his nightmare. Tobias thinks it's drugs, and said so in a private conversation with Nancy.</li>
            <li>I think Eugene took a warning shot at the trees above us?</li>
            <li>Did Vernon actually go with Arthur or just clock that he left?</li>
          </ul>

          <p>As another night approaches, the group is exhausted, emotional and feeling increasingly uneasy. Although we did find Eugene which is encouraging.</p>
          <p>Tobias is trying to stabilise Eugene but it takes a long time and the sun sets. He removes the bullet but the wound is infected and he's still feverish. Meanwhile, Vernon and Arthur are at the artists' camp and see paintings of a path with yellow leaves and a dishevelled cabin, that impossibly look exactly like the ones Vernon saw in his nightmares last night. They leave the camp and walk back and rejoin the main group. Arthur tells the group about the artists' camp (but Vernon doesn't for some reason (¬_¬)).</p>

        </BlogItem>

        <BlogItem itemTitle="Second Night">
          <p>The group goes to the artists' camp for the night, because it's already set up and has fire and cooking facilities. We see possessions including two guns matching the ones we think Arthur and Brian, the other father and son hunters we heard about, would have had. Many essential possessions have been abandoned here. Dr Tobias investigates the camp and sees no bodies, but blood, evidence of a fight between more than ten people and of people being dragged out of tents and into the forest eastwards.</p>
          <p>Vernon stares at the paintings and has a vivid but impossible memory of his mother sitting with him by the lake saying she's disappointed in what he's done with his life. She begs him to help her, she needs him to come to the lake. Vernon backstory: he has been covertly setting up a legal situation to con Lucas Strong out of Jane's substantial inheritance, and to succeed in this needs Jane to disappear and  Lucas's business to fail, and he's been covertly trying to effect these.</p>
          <p>Eugene insists that the kidnapper gang are only 3 people, and not the 10+ people we see in the evidence of the scuffle here. Eugene says that Jane seemed calm while being held hostage, and not upset, but Sidney told him not to question it. Eugene draws a green mark on the map where he's saying the hideout is. We, with Gordon's psychoanalysis, conclude that Jane probably has been in a relationship with Sidney. We can't figure out the deal with the other events, nor Sidney's seeming need for ransom money, though.</p>
          <p>The party sleeps.</p>
          <p>Dr. Tobias has a dream about when she was a young girl (!) and her father, a successful surgeon, invites her to learn about medicine by doing surgery in their kitchen. He shows her a heart with a special mineral in it, found from an excavation, that keeps it alive when hardly ever beating.</p>
          <p>Gordon dreams about St Teresa leading him to the lake, where people are praying to the lake, and St Teresa spears them one by one with her ecstasy spear. They chant about living forever. St Teresa tells Gordon to bring the group to the lake and a giant beautiful eye appears above her head.</p>
          <p>Nancy is on watch. She seems someone standing very still at just about 100 metres away, silently watching the camp, with glistening obsolete military buttons, with a covered face. She tries to act like she hasn't noticed them, and looks away, and doesn't see them again when she looks back. She tells this to Tobias when she wakes him for his turn to watch. Tobias is very concerned that the watcher is a very serious risk to our safety but we can't move Eugene, his patient, so he also decides not to escalate and only to continue vigilance.</p>
          <p>Arthur is sleeping in the artists' studio tent. He dreams about speeding through space, initially feeling joyous but then claustrophic as he feels limited by his mere three-dimensional freedom locked off from the rest. He's travelling in a crystal  but it crashes into a planet and shatters and he senses struggling deep underwater and sensing aeons pass, trying but failing to repair his crystal. He sees creatures build and destroy civilizations and reaches out with his mind but the creatures are too ignorant and limited to communicate with.</p>
          <p>Vernon has a similar dream and sees civilizations fall and rise and tries to connect to his family's past in Ireland. Reaching out with his mind, he cannot communicate with them but he can nudge them.</p>

          <p>In the middle of the night the group are woken up by an EXPLOSION BOOM BOOM! They can see a huge blue light in the distance illuminating the forest and sky for many seconds. We think its size is consistent with the dynamite box we saw in the truck yesterday, but not the blue colour. Tobias is here to see if the reservoir site's minerals anr/or scientific curiosities are being covered up for seizing or to prevent issues with Lucas Strong's investment in the reservoir. There are some rumours of gold, or of poisonous deposits.</p>
          <p>Another search party of five approaches the camp, exhausted and scared. The lady that seems to be in charge says they aren't being paid enough for this, and they want to join with us and return to town as soon as possible. They claim their infirmness is due to eating spoiled meat but we can tell they're just excusing their deep terror. It's still the middle of the night so we all try to get some more sleep before morning.</p>
          <p>We sleep normally, without any unearthly dreams.</p>
        </BlogItem>
        
        <BlogItem itemTitle="Third Day">
          <p>The morning is bright. The daylight starkly exhibits the signs of the struggle here.</p>
          <p>Nancy tells the group of the watcher she saw in the night, and that the day revealed foot tracks leading east from his vantage point. For the group's next move, several characters have private compulsions and motivations to leave the rescue, maybe leave it to the police, and go to the lake instead, but our consciences, heads and Agy eventually prevail and we head towards where we believe the hideout is. Meanwhile the other search party depart for civilization, with the injured Eugene, to alert the police of everything the search parties have learned.</p>
          <p>The forest is taller than the expected, hiding the sky, and totally silent. After three hours we come to a clearing with the cabin, but outside Christopher Dobbs is long dead, stinking, impaled on a horizontal bloody jagged branch, his feet dangling several feet above ground level. The cabin has bullet holes in the walls. Agy approaches and shots are fired towards her through the door. Sidney's terrified voice comes from inside asking us to return Jane to him, that he knows we're demons and he'll kill us all.</p>
          <p>Gordon talks down Sidney, opens the door, puts his arm round him and prays with him for him to be forgiven, reformed and brought back into God's family - though he doesn't put down his shotgun. Dobbs seems to have been dead for more than a day. There are tracks towards the east, from unusably worn shoes, with signs of maybe a person being dragged, and a dropped necklace with a little blood on it. No other belongings of Jane are here.</p>
          <p>The group speculate that there are other actors at play in the forest, the ones dressed in the obsolete military uniform. Arthur suggests that perhaps they are the ghost of the deserters who were once here.... or they are immortal!</p>

          <p>In the cabin are two guns (.25 Deringer handgun, and a .45 automatic), 20 bullets, and the ransom money.
            Sidney confirms that he and Jane were eloping, and staging the kidnapping for money for their new life. 
            Sidney says that Christopher Dobbs was left with Jane in the cabin, and that when he returned to the cabin Dobbs was already dead and Jane was already gone.</p>
          <p>Sidney speaks of demons, and voices whispering that he will "join them", but he didn't see anything. He doesn't clearly remember what happened. Sidney relinquishes his shotgun to Gordon.
            Sidney said Jane insisted on bringing none of her possessions, to sell the kidnap story, so they honestly had no luggage with them.
            Sidney is defeated and downhearted. Without his gun, he comes with us to find Jane. The group believe he loves Jane and don't tie him up.</p>
          <p>The group follow the tracks of the dragging and find a road. The road has been used by traffic and confuses the tracks, and forks. 
            One fork leads east into the forest, with yellow leaves and sick trees, that some of the group have seen in their dreams. Sidney has also seen it in his dreams and is terrified, and to us the look in his eyes is just as terrifying. Nancy might have heard Jane's voice very very faintly from this way?</p>
          <p>The other fork is northerly road, and some of us can faintly hear vehicle noises coming from that way. Huck is just about able to find the track on it.</p>
        </BlogItem>

        <BlogItem itemTitle="Into The Lake">
          <p>We take the road and arrive at the gate to the excavation site, which is in a small, bare spherical valley. Four people are working, carrying things to and from cabin 5 and a hole in the centre of the bowl-like site. There is a rope system between the mine head (above the hole) and the lake, with the trees cut to make a path for it. The tracks are no longer visible on the well-used path here. </p>
          <p>We talk to Richard at the gate, who seems odd and is wearing heavy clothes in this hot weather. Agy says Lucas Strong sent us and we are directed to talk to Carl White. 
            Nancy sees a lot of dynamite crates and other standard mining equipment, but she doesn't understand the rope/pulley line from the mine head to the lake.</p>
          <p>Carl is very pale. Carl leads us to cabin 1 near the gate to talk about our mission. Nancy thinks Carl has seen a visitor he's not telling us about. The cabin has uneaten food that looks like it was more fresh several days ago. Huck spots very very old, very very worn and weathered walking boots in the corner.</p>
          <p>Tobias notices that the workers don't seem to actually work on the hole, they are just carrying things. Tobias sneaks to look through the back windows of the five large cabins. Cabin 1 is an office with geological study materials visible. Cabin 2 has beds. Cabin 3 seems like living quarters but unused. Cabin 4's rear window is boarded-up from the inside.</p>
          <p>Carl White is arguing with us and suddenly has a strong pain in his chest and vomits a small amount of black liquid onto the table, and then seems fine again. Carl stops Agy from looking through the door to the next room, claiming it's locked, but Agy pushes past and opens it. It is a larder but with some kind of upright stone sarcophagus covered with strange symbols. The coffin door pushes open and blue light comes out. Inside is a figure wearing 60-year-old  military dress, completely pale, with face sunken showing the shape of their skull. Pure black stone protrusions come out of their hands and face, but they don't quite move with them, kind of floatily following at a slightly different time.</p>
          <p>Father Gordon is struck with understanding of this creature, remembering that his treasured book, by his friend and scholar Joseph Fritborn, foretold its coming, and is deeply, suddenly terrified. The creature says to the group that Gla'aki is nearly awoken. On roll20 the creature's name is August.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, Tobias and Arthur hear a plaintive child's voice coming from cabin 4, saying they're scared. </p>
          <p>Agy and Nancy exit the cabin and sees the mine workers, Dean, James and Richard start to come towards the cabins. Three workers surround them as they try to break open the boarded window of cabin 4, believing Jane to be inside.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile Arthur darts to cabin 5 while he sees people being distracted by the events of the other cabin. Inside is another creature with strange stone protrusions coming out of their body, completely pale, wearing obsolete military uniform with one missing button. Arthur falls to his knees in awe, and understands that this is one of the immortals and wants to understand how they got this gift, and the price they paid.</p>
          <p>Gordon opens the sarcophagus again and the creature says Gordon has been chosen to help awaken "her", to end suffering. They have found a fragment of Gla'aki's prison, which is extradimensional, in the crater, which they will raise tonight. Gla'aki will be freed by finding all the shards from the impact with Earth.</p>
          <p>Carl shouts that it's over, we've been found out, and calls to the other workers to stop the adventurers from leaving. Huck tries to pull Gordon away from the Sarcophagus, and Carl tries to pull them both away. Carl and Huck brawl, and Huck lays Carl out with a punch.</p>
          <p>Tobias exits the cabin and points her gun at the mine workers to protect Agy and Nancy. Nancy succeeds at breaking the boarding and inside are Jane, Brian and his father Arthur, tied up. Agy passes her knife inside. Nancy and Tobias open fire on the mine workers as they try to grab the adventurers. Tobias pulls together everything he can muster, shaking, orders the miners to stop and put their hands up, accidentally fires his gun and it shoots a knife out of Richard's hands. The miners are stunned and put their hands up.</p>
          <p>Arthur is prone to madness recurring for one hour. Gordon is prone to madness recurring for five hours.
            The adventurers leave the cabin and are all stood outside, and they interrogate their three pale prisoners. 
            Brian, Arthur and Jane are rescued and untied. Jane and Agy embrace tearfully.
            A blue light starts emanating from the mine shaft.</p>
          <p>The miners explain to us all that the mine is the prison of Gla'aki, and they have been capturing people from the forest to turn them into more workers to assist with the recovery.
            Tobias examines Richard and sees his obsidian growth on his chest, that phases in and out of seeming real.
            Jane and Arthur say the artists were tied up in the cabin with them until yesterday when they were moved, and she heard screams coming from the south.
            Tobias's curiosity overcomes him and trying to remove the stone from the chest of the man, cuts into his chest with a scalpel. The flesh is tough, doesn't bleed, and blunts the scalpel.</p>
          <p>Huck searches the cabins, sees the servant of Gla'aki, and flees in terror to the lake. The trees on the lake shore all have yellow leaves. </p>
          <p>Huck calls people to the lake and some of the group go to the lake. Others get in the van with the rescued people and try to drive past the lakeside to pick up the rest of the group so we can all drive away from this.</p>
          <p>At the lake are the unconscious artists tied to five wooden poles emerging from the shore, with thin black stone stakes piercing through their chests. </p>
          <p>The lake water is in violent uproar. A shape emerges from the water. Gla'aki flies through the air.</p>
          <p>Gla'aki looks at one of the rescued artists and their stone starts absorbing into their body. Huck drops them.</p>
          <p>Vernon persuades Jane and Sidney to get out of the van and take the opportunity to flee. They see Gla'aki. They freeze in pure horror.</p>
          <p>Arthur is driving the truck and keeps driving for hundreds of yards until he's persuaded to stop by the sight of Agy and Jane trying to run to get back in.</p>
          <p>Huck shoots at Gla'aki but it can dodge using more dimensions than just three and the bullets do not intersect Gla'aki in the vast multidimensional space. Gla'aki knocks Huck unconscious with a retaliatory attack. Tobias gets to him and rips the alien fragment out of Huck's leg and stops the bleeding. Sidney and Tobias get Huck into the truck. Now everyone is in the truck.</p>
          <p>Arthur drives the truck though the forest, past a cabin, and back to the site road. It's dark now. </p>
        </BlogItem>

        <BlogItem itemTitle="Epilogue">
          <p>The investigators return to town. </p>
          <p>Tobias, Arthur and Gordon take Jane, Sidney and Huck to the police station. Huck gets medical care.</p>
          <p>The night sergeant is Chris and he is outranked by a federal agent, who starts taking our statements but shuts her notebook when we seem to be babbling impossible things.</p>
          <p>Tobias notices that the federal agent doesn't seem to have the expected id and logos on her clothes and notebook. It has a green triangle symbol.</p>
          <p>The night sergeant takes notes on everything Gordon tells him until Gordon falls asleep, but in fact does not wake up the chief nor take appropriate action to the pile of corpses, murders and kidnappings Gordon is describing.</p>
          <p>Vernon takes a gun, drives across town to Lucas Strong's house, pounds on the door, wakes the butler and demands to talk to Lucas Strong. Lucas comes. Vernon is convinced Lucas already knows about his plot and how he tried to sabotage the rescue. Lucas is nonplussed. Vernon pulls his gun, hand shaking. Lucas doesn't become any less calm and says he's not afraid of Vernon because he knows he's a coward. Vernon cries.</p>
          <p>Vernon tries to shoot himself but rolls a 97 and the bullet shatters a mirror behind him instead. Vernon breaks down, broken. Lucas is impassive and pours himself a brandy, and another for Vernon, and invites Vernon to a chair.</p>
          <p>Nancy goes to her house and stays up all night reading her book about the (new!) theory of relativity and poring over old newspaper stories of strange events.</p>
          <p>Huck and Gordon both dream about a shimmering, flowing glass object being retrieved from the mine and drained of energy by Gla'aki. </p>
          <p>The police go to the sites in the forest the next day. At the mine, everything has been destroyed by dynamite.</p>
          <p>Dobbs, the artists and the other bodies are brought back to town and cremated.</p>
          <p>Over the next weeks and months Lucas Strong's supposed business activities with the mine, dam, lake and reservoir collapse.</p>
          <p>Tobias doesn't report back any of the shocking events to Theo, who sent him to find out information.</p>
